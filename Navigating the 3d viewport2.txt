Navigating the 3D viewport - 

There are many tools within Maya2017, some of these being the ability to create manipulatable polygons at the click of a button, 
or tools such as the extruder tool. There are also plenty of functions that you can use to help you move around the 3D grid within the program. 
Some of these are alt+left click to move your camera around the viewport, alt+middle click to slide the viewport right or left and alt+right click 
to zoom in and out fairly easily. In addition to alt+click commands, there are preset hotkeys to switch between tools. For example, the hotkey q is 
designed to intantly switch over to your selection tool, and the hotkey e activates the rotate tool.
