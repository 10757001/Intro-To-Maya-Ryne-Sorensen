Creating a Maya project - 

Maya has a file button in the top left corner with a drop down menu. At the bottom of this dropdown menu
there is a Project Window and Set Project button. Project Window allows you to create a new project
including giving you the ability to choose where it saves to, what it saves, and what folders within
the project you do and don't keep. You can save the location and name of your project at the top
of the Project Window. This enables you to save to whatever you want, be that a flash drive, directly to your hard drive
or a folder on your desktop.
