Working with scene files - 


Under the file menu of Maya, there are three ways to save your scene for your project. First, the save button, which everyone should be familiar with, it saves the project you have, fast and easy, however it doesn't allow you to change any of the information regarding where it is saved, or the saved file name. The second option, save as allows you to change the name, which will save it as a whole new file instead of overwriting the previous one, and you can also change the location it saves to at any given time. 
The last way you can save a scene in Maya would be Increment and save, this feature is similar to the save as function, in the sense that it allows you to save your files without writing over the previous ones. With Save as you need to edit the name manually, increment and save automatically changes the information for you. Your scene may be "CubeProject" and the increment and save function may rename it "CubeProject0001." You can also set up autosave functions to help prevent data loss due to forgetting to backup or save your work. 
This can be enabled through the windows preferences menu within Maya, clicking Files Projects, and then Autosave. You can freely edit how and when it saves your projects, be that every 5 minutes, or every 30 minutes. All of these scenes that are saved are saved inside your scene folder in your Maya Profile we spoke about earlier.
