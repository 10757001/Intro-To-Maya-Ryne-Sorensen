Working the user interface - 

The user interface within Maya has many features for you to use in an easy and accessable way. Some of these include new features being highlighted with green brackets. Along the top of the Maya client,there are menu buttons that you can expand into tools and actions, and you may move the floating window wherever you like. There are toolbox buttons located in the upper right hand corner that compile similar toolsets togetherto make them as conveinent as possible, these are toolkits such as modeling, animation, shading, etc. Maya uses a coordinate grid to keep track of where your models are at, you can find the coordinate points for the x/y/z axison the right side of the screen, below the toolkit buttons mentioned earlier. You can create a Maya project within the file menu, and selecting new project.
